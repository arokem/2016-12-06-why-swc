### Who am I?
--

<image src="images/huji-logo.png" height=100px> I am originally from West Jerusalem, Israel

???
I come from West Jerusalem, in Israel. In college, at the Hebrew University, I studied Biology and Psychology. This education provided a basis for my interest in interdisciplinary work and for graduate school...
--

<image src="images/berkeley-logo.png" height=100px> Ph.D. In neuroscience

???
...I came to the United States, and studied, at the University of California, Berkeley
--

<image src="images/stanford-logo.png" height=100px> Research experience in computational neuroimaging

???
After graduate school, I spent a few years conducting research in computational neuroimaging, as a post-doc at Stanford.

 <image src="images/scipy-logo.png" height=100px> <image src="images/nipy-logo.png" height=100px> Open source software development

???
In graduate school, I started developing open-source software for computational neuroimaging, and became part of a community called "NIPY" (or neuroimaging in Python), which uses the Python programming language to develop open-source tools for analysis of data from human neuroimaging.

# What is Software Carpentry

--

- "Since 1998, Software Carpentry has been teaching researchers in science, engineering, medicine, and related disciplines the computing skills they need to get more done in less time and with less pain."

--

- Volunteer instructors.

--

- Democratically governed non-profit organization

--

- All the materials are freely reusable.

--

- Lessons are community developed.

---

### My SWC history

--

- I knew about the (Matlab!) materials while in grad school

--

- First time I helped was in 2011 (12?)

--

- Certified as an instructor in 2012

--

- Instructor trainer since last year



---

## Why do I do it?

--

- "Self defense"

--

- Best way to learn is by teaching

--

- Teaching is also fun!

--

- I care about the standards of my field

--

- When I was a post-doc, I enjoyed the travel

--

- Brought me to places I wanted to go for career reasons

--

- But also places I just wanted to visit!

--

- Amazing community of practice to be part of

--

- And a tremendously useful network!

### What's next?

--

If you have never attended a  SWC workshop, come join one as a helper!

--

**January 9th - 12th**

--

If you've helped, come and teach!

--

**March 27th-28th**

--

Either way: sign up for the mailing lists:

http://lists.software-carpentry.org/

---

## Do you want to get certified as a SWC instructor?

--

What it entails:

- 2-day Instructor training workshop (some time in Spring 2017?)

- A couple of small follow-up assignments

--

[The curriculum](http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/):

- Introduce participants to a handful of key research findings and show how they can be used to help people learn better and faster.

- Introduce participants to the teaching practices that have been adopted by the Software and Data Carpentry communities, and the overall philosophy and procedures of both organizations in order to prepare them to teach at Software and Data Carpentry workshops.

---

## Potential benefits:

--

- To run SWC workshops, there needs to be one certified instructor

--

- You can be that person in your next position

--

- Something to write in your teaching statement.

--

- Learn some useful things about teaching?
